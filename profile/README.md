# Integrative-Longevity-Omics

This GitHub Organization account will collect all the tools, workflows, and analysis scripts developed and/or adopted by the [ILO initiative](https://longevityomics.org/).

_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

# Overview
The ILO is generating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics data. These will be processed and QC-ed based on workflows and pipelines that will be included here. In particular, transcriptomics data will be processed based on [pipeliner-2](https://github.com/montilab/pipeliner-2), cross-species proteomics data will be processed based on workflows described in [Cross-Species](https://github.com/Integrative-Longevity-Omics/Cross-Species), metabolomics data will be processed by [Metabolon](https://github.com/Integrative-Longevity-Omics/Metabolon-based-metabolomics), and metagenomics data will be processed based on the [MGS_pipeline](https://github.com/Integrative-Longevity-Omics/MGS_pipeline).

# Resources

Some of the repositories live under other associated GigHub organization accounts, and are linked here.

- [**nf-core/rnaseq**](nf-core/rnaseq): RNA sequencing analysis pipeline using STAR, RSEM, HISAT2 or Salmon with gene/isoform counts and extensive quality control. This is now the pipeline used by ILO to process all RNAseq data, superseding _pipeliner-2_.

- [**pipeliner-2**](https://github.com/montilab/pipeliner-2): A flexible Nextflow-based workflow for the processing of RNA-sequencing data. This is a DSL2 upgrade of our original [pipeliner](https://github.com/montilab/pipeliner) framework [[Federico A, et al., 2019]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00614)

- [**yQTL-pipeline**](https://github.com/montilab/yQTL-Pipeline): A Nextflow- and R-based pipeline to streamline the execution of multi-step QTL discovery analyses. Built using Nextflow DSL2. <br>
